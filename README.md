### Assignment 2 CIS 410

I did not include uses of dot product, linear interpolation or particle effects.

I did have an idea to detect enemies nearby John Lemon and use images to display direction
and distance warnings to the players screen. I unfortunately ran out of time and did not finish
implementing these.

I did start to implement these features as seen in the John Lemon prefab there is an enemy field
with a capsule colider to detect enemies. The starting script called EnemyDetection has the logic
which is very similar to the GameEnding script as in it detects an enemy character, then updates the images
accordingly.
